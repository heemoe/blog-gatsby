Glad, you want to learn more about me.

This blog is my second site building with Gatsby.js, the old one is no longer update. This is a new beginning, I want to practice my English through write, as you see there is no other Languages(except JavaScript...). I'm fortunate enough to love what I do. I'm focusing build and design web/mobile application recently. Adobe XD is my favorite UI design tool that is free and available on Windows. I prefer Vue.js or React.js to implement prototypes, also I'd like to try the latest technologies. 

And more...
